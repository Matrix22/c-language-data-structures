This project is a collection of small objects that consist into a big library.

The project is divided in two main sub-projects:

* *[Void Pointer data structures](voidptr_data_structs/README.md)* - which are generic data structures implemented using the void pointer.
* *[Macros data structures](macros_data_structs/README.md)* - which are the void pointer tructures reimplemented using macros.

## Getting Started

In orther to use the c-language-data-structures project, make sure to navigate to the readmes of every project appart and to take step by step every documentation of a different data struction, even though they practically represent the same idea, the implementations and the examples are quite different from structure to structure.

## Contributing

I am very open for contributing, however if you want to take part of this project you will have to follow some set of rules:

* First you should respect the code styling, some references are [C Style](https://github.com/mcinglis/c-style)
* You should provide documentation (respecting doxygen standard) for every function or piece of code
* You should come with some tests or examples to show how to work with your new functions
* Be happy and don't stop coding
